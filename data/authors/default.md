Hello fellow!

Welcome to this corner of the wide network, we know as internet.

I am a working professional, currently working as a Python Developer at [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/). I have worked with Python since the start of my career, and won't hesitate to call myself a Pythonista. I have previously worked as as Software Engineer in Backend and have experience working with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

I am huge follower of Open source ideology and enjoy contributing to open source whenever I can.
